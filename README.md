# THIS CURRENTLY ONLY WORKS ON LANGUAGES THAT DO NOT TRANSLATE THE TIME
Short userscript to replace the upload date of posts with your own timezone instead of the one Scratch uses.

## Usage
Install a monkey ([Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net), for example), go to "main.user.js", and click "Raw". It will prompt you to install the script. Now, when viewing a post, all times will use your local timezone!
